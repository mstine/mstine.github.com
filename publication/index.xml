      <title>Migrating to Cloud Native Application Architectures</title>
      <link>https://www.mattstine.com/publication/migrating-to-cloud-native/</link>

      <description>Author Matt Stine also examines the cultural, organizational, and technical changes necessary to migrate traditional monolithic applications and service-oriented architectures to cloud-native architectures. You’ll also find a Migration Cookbook, with recipes for decomposing monolithic applications into microservices, implementing fault-tolerant patterns, and performing automated testing of cloud-native services.
This report discusses application architectures that include:
 The Twelve-Factor App: a collection of cloud-native app architecture patterns Microservices: independently deployable services that do one thing well Self-Service Agile Infrastructure: platforms for rapid, repeatable, and consistent provisioning of app environments and backing services API-based Collaboration: published and versioned APIs that allow interaction between services in a cloud-native app architecture Anti-Fragility: systems that get stronger when subjected to stress  </description>
