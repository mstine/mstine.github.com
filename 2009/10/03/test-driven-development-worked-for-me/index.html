    <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Our team got to spend a few days with Jared Richardson this week, talking tech leadership, agile, and automated testing. At some point during the opening day&rsquo;s discussion, I related the story of how I initially got into Test Driven Development (TDD) and how it seriously ramped up my productivity and decreased my defect count.</p>

<p>In early 2003, we were slowly dragging through development of the first version of our Shared Resource Management system. At the time our development model looked a little something like this:</p>

<p>1) Code until you run into an unimplemented dependency;
2) Repeat until one of the dependencies is checked in;
3) Big Bang Integration!
4) Debug, debug, debug&hellip;
5) Repeat until something pseudo-demoable is ready.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, this wasn&rsquo;t a very productive way to work, but unfortunately it was all most of us knew. At the time I thought we really needed to improve on our testing so that we could eliminate a lot of the defects that at the time I didn&rsquo;t realize were being caused by our development model. I asked my boss if I could start a QA effort and not too much later found the XP/Agile Universe conference that was held in August 2003. It was my hope that we could learn about how to properly test/QA our software there as there seemed to be a lot of talks about this &ldquo;TDD&rdquo; thing. I got approval to attend, and while down there I was immersed in this new culture of Extreme Programming (XP) and Agile.</p>

<p>At one point I ventured into a room that was setup like what many of us would call a SCRUM/Team room today, where a group of folks were all coding away on a system and making its &ldquo;Fit&rdquo; tests pass. I quickly paired up with a gentleman and we went to work. At some point Brian Marick came over and asked what we were working on. I fumbled through a description of the requirement and he then asked, &ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;s your test?&rdquo; I said that we didn&rsquo;t have one, and he then said something that at the time was very profound to me, &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t write any code until you have a failing test!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spent most of my time waiting in the airport to return to Memphis reading Uncle Bob&rsquo;s &ldquo;Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices.&rdquo; Needless to say, I was fired up.</p>

<p>When I returned to work in the following weeks, I essentially tried two different tactics in parallel to share what I learned with my team.</p>

<p>First, I practiced what Jared calls &ldquo;2x4 Development,&rdquo; or, beating your team in the shins with a 2x4 until they start doing TDD, pair programming, continuous integration, etc. I even delivered my own version of the agile manifesto to the entire department, and the most profound comments I got out of that were &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ever imagine us paying two developers to sit at the same computer and work on the same code,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;s going to test the test code?!?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Needless to say, this didn&rsquo;t work very well. My second tactic was much more guerrilla in nature. I told the guy that I was working with that I didn&rsquo;t care what he did with the rest of his time, as long as he checked in his interfaces before he started to code. Now I had something to mock! I then proceeded to TDD all of my code. I advertised my productivity in terms of test cases passing with a little counter on my whiteboard. Development was fun again, as I could get instant feedback on how my code was working and I knew that it was interacting properly with its dependencies. Sure enough, when those big bang integrations happened, my code rarely seemed to be the source of the defects, and I quickly found myself getting pulled into other parts of the code to help develop since I had already gotten my typical assignment finished!</p>

<p>We delivered the section of the system that I developed using TDD much faster than any part that I had worked on up to that point (no hard numbers, but I have a pretty good memory of that time), and in addition, I wrote the CLEANEST code I had ever written up to that point.</p>

<p>So, while Jared wouldn&rsquo;t recommend you try TDD if the rest of your team isn&rsquo;t on board - you&rsquo;re never going to get someone who doesn&rsquo;t care about tests to fix one that they broke - this guerrilla tactic worked well for me and got me some recognition as a guy who could write good clean code fast! If I could go back to that point, I think I would have tried <a href="http://www.jaredrichardson.net/blog/2005/11/03/">Defect Driven Testing</a> first or in addition to my GTDD.</p>

<p>So, how are you getting your team test infected?</p>
