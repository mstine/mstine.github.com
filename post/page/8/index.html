      So yesterday I was attempting to debug an issue in a batch processing module within one of our applications. In short, an assertion was failing deep within Hibernate as it attempted to flush the session. Using a combination of various log statements, I had isolated the problem down to a particular record that the batch process was attempting to update. (BTW: I know you shouldn&rsquo;t be using Hibernate for batch processing - however, we&rsquo;re talking about batches of at most 1000 records here, not millions!

      I came across a link today that would allow you to post &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; code in any HTML page. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of problems (as have others) posting well-formatted source code to my Blogger-based blog. I&rsquo;ve wanted to correct this problem for some time, and this project appears to be a decent solution. Here&rsquo;s an example:
function chooseWinner() {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; $(&lsquo;p3&rsquo;).removeClassName(&lsquo;winner&rsquo;);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; participantBo.chooseWinnerForEvent(eventId, function(data) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; people = $A(data);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; updateDivs();&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; intervalId = setInterval(doShift, 500);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; });&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;}  Now that isn&rsquo;t too bad is it?

      I got an awesome email today&hellip;
 We are happy to announce that the video/audio streaming from TSE 2007 will be available online the week of February 11th for you. You will have the opportunity to see/hear the TSE 2007 presentations you were not able to make at TSE 2007 due to all of the great sessions available per time period. We have captured the entire session length including any demos/live coding.

      Are Java&rsquo;s days numbered as a web development technology? With buzzwords like Ruby, Rails, and Web 2.0 zipping around the web development community, one may begin to wonder. Could Java&rsquo;s lifespan be extended by finding synergy between Java and Ruby? On the scene comes JRuby, the definitive implementation of Ruby for the JVM. In his new book from Apress, Ola Bini guides the reader through the development of four Web 2.

      Back in July I posted my professional development goals for the year (My performance review is annually in July, so it&rsquo;s a good time to set goals.), and it seemed like a good idea to take a look at my progress while doing the &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Resolution&rdquo; thing.
 Learn Groovy and Grails
  Andy and Dave suggest learning a new language every year, so this seemed like a good goal for me.

      Well, after a short hiatus of getting back to &ldquo;real&rdquo; work, I&rsquo;m going to attempt to squeeze in another Spring Experience 2007 entry. This particular session was my first of Friday morning. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed Keith Donald as a speaker, having first heard him at TheServerSide.com&rsquo;s Java In Action conference in 2005, and again during his Java University session at JavaOne 2007.
Keith began with a discussion of why we need patterns.

      Well it had to end eventually. As you can see, I&rsquo;m hopelessly behind on my blog entries, having only made it through my first day of sessions. I&rsquo;ve still got several more I intend to cover (I probably won&rsquo;t do the last two as I started blanking out - I think my brain was pretty much melted by this afternoon). Look for those entries in the coming days. Many thanks go out to No Fluff Just Stuff and SpringSource for putting on an awesome conference!

      This was a truly fascinating talk. If you ever wanted to learn the entire history and landscape of dependency injection (DI), this was your opportunity. I really didn&rsquo;t realize how deep of a topic DI really is.
According to Rod, DI had its beginnings in 2002, in the Interface 21 Framework that was born from his seminal work, Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development. In the beginning, DI was done solely through setter injection (SI), with external metadata (usually in XML).

      This talk looked really exciting going in. Jeremy is a member of the Spring Web Products team and the lead of Spring Faces, as well as a member of the JSF 2.0 Expert Group. He describes himself as the resident Ajax freak at SpringSource. Jeremy began by discussing the current Ajax landscape, highlighting what he believes are the important features a successful framework must deliver, and then identifying the frameworks he considers to be the cream of the crop.
