      I posted earlier on my desire to become a better programmer. Well, I&rsquo;ve since put together a plan of action for the next twelve months. I&rsquo;ve based some of these goals on suggestions from The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas.
 Learn Groovy and Grails
  Andy and Dave suggest learning a new language every year. I had already informally started learning Groovy and Grails after JavaOne 2007.

      <p>Ryan Cooper writes a brilliant essay on why quick fixes today turn into tomorrow&rsquo;s code rot. I believe every word of this article. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m all too often my own worst enemy when it comes to implementing these ideas. Thanks for the reminder, Ryan!</p>

      Graeme Rocher, founder of the Grails project, answers five more misconceptions about Groovy/Grails vs. Ruby/Rails. I&rsquo;ve grown to be quite fond of both of these languages/frameworks; however, given the amount of investment I&rsquo;ve placed into learning and applying Spring and Hibernate to the applications I&rsquo;ve developed over the past two years, I have to say that Grails just makes sense for me as the next step toward becoming more &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; in my approach to development projects.

      I have decided to embark upon a quest to become a better programmer. I would really like to improve my understanding of the computer science that underlies my day-to-day tasks, particularly as it relates to programming language design as well as algorithm design and complexity analysis. I would also like to improve my analytical and problem solving skills. I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;m really good at learning new technologies and quickly bringing them to bear on web application development problems, but take me out of that problem space and I get nervous rather quickly.

      Recently I was faced with the challenge of implementing form-level (or page-level) validation in a JSF-based application. What I mean by form-level validation is the need to evaluate a subset of a form&rsquo;s fields as a unit, rather than simply validating each field in isolation. An example of this type of validation can be found on a user registration form where one has to select a password in one text field, and then retype the same password in another text field for confirmation.

      It&rsquo;s Friday night, and what am I doing but coding. My wife&rsquo;s night out is spent at the scrapbook store working on her latest layouts - mine is at my new favorite coffee shop, working on open source. I discovered this place on a date with Wendy a couple of months ago. The nice thing about it is the distinctly Christian atmosphere. A good friend of mine and I meet here on Friday mornings for accountability.

      I recently migrated all of my Java/Development related posts from <a href="http://www.analienandastranger.com">http://www.analienandastranger.com</a>. I want to make this a PRIMARILY Java/Development-related blog. When I was splitting my efforts between Christianity and Software Development, I was quickly getting burned out and not writing anything. If you want to read any of my old devotional posts, I will be keeping the other blog alive for awhile. Since the hosting is being provided to me free (as well as the domain), I will in good conscience need to shut it down eventually.

      I really enjoyed &ldquo;The Toy Show&rdquo; this morning. James Gosling went through a flurry of different demos from around the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; Java world. I was especially impressed with Project Wonderland (<a href="http://lg3d-wonderland.dev.java.net/">http://lg3d-wonderland.dev.java.net/</a>), a virtual workplace environment, and with the real-time robotics demos. Unfortunately I was so sucked in that I didn&rsquo;t get any good photos.
If anything you could call this my day on the back end. I attended four sessions, two of which were focused on that.

      for me, not for JavaOne. Of course I was a good little programmer and used the schedule builder to sign up for all of my sessions. I edited them a bit after the first two keynotes. Even then, I had one lone session scheduled for Thursday morning (that wasn&rsquo;t really directly applicable to my work, it just looked interesting), and then two sessions in the afternoon, the first starting at 4:10.

      Not officially, but nearly every session I attended had something to do with AJAX:
 Creating Amazing Web Interfaces with Ajax
 jMaki: Web 2.0 App Building Made Easy
 Fast, Beautiful, Easy: Pick Three - Building Web User Interfaces in the Java Programming Language with Google Web Toolkit
 Killer JavaScript Technology Frameworks for Java Platform Developers: An Exploration of Prototype, Script.aculo.us, and Rico
  I have to say that I was rather impressed by what I saw.
