      <description>I have rebooted this blog many times over the last several years. If you&amp;rsquo;ve been a reader of my blog in the past, you will have noticed significant changes. If you&amp;rsquo;re new here, welcome!
This reboot has been in the works for several months now, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve probably spent far less than 24 active hours working on it. Life as an &amp;ldquo;itinerant&amp;rdquo; consultant and conference speaker is extremely busy compared to what I was doing on May 16, 2012 (the date of my last blog posting).</description>
