      <description>Microservices are often described as small, loosely coupled applications that follow the UNIX philosophy of &amp;#8220;doing one thing well.&amp;#8221; They have also been related to the Single Responsibility Principle, the first of the five principles making up SOLID. A microservices-based architecture is typically constructed around a set of common patterns. This set of patterns is actually consistent with all of the SOLID principles when thought of at the architectural rather than the class/module level.</description>
