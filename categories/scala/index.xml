      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m in the midst of planning my next toy project, specifically with an aim to build something for the cloud, be it Google App Engine, Mor.ph, EC2, etc. (that part is still up for grabs). What I&amp;rsquo;d like to do is an opt-in blog aggregation site focused around functional programming. It would be very similar to what Glen Smith has done with groovyblogs.org. Groovyblogs is currently my number one referral site and is generating about 20% of the traffic for this blog.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I pontificated on my need to choose a new &amp;ldquo;Language of the Year.&amp;rdquo; Right now I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to choose between Scala and Clojure. If nothing else, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from this exercise that asking the community for feedback is a GOOD thing. Your comments have been very helpful.
To summarize:
 As far as the polls go, Scala is in the lead by a margin of 4 to 2.</description>
