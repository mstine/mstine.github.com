      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me set the stage for you. I&amp;rsquo;m driving home happily listening to Ted Neward discuss the merits of Scala on the Javaworld podcast. As I pull into the driveway I see my wife waving frantically in the window. As geek brain struggles to process this, home brain kicks into gear. She needs me in the house now! I jump out of the car and slam the door shut, leaving all of the belongings I typically carry in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enter the house to find that a wasp has some how gotten in and is terrorizing the family. What ensues is roughly 15 minutes of wasp hunting. Wasp dead - end of story. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m driving my iPod (attached to the iTrip FM transmitter/charger) typically sits in my lap (for some reason I get the least FM interference that way). What I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice in my hasty departure from the vehicle is that my iPod nano flew out of the vehicle and was hanging by the iTrip cable. Unaware of this, I slammed the door on the cable and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in and of itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t a huge problem. Leaving it that way for approximately 24 hours - most of which included rather steady rainfall - was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a quick Google search finds that the consensus approach seems to be sticking the iPod in a cup of dry rice to soak up the moisture. So there you have it - my iPod is on rice. I hope it works. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
