      <description>Let me set the stage for you. I&amp;rsquo;m driving home happily listening to Ted Neward discuss the merits of Scala on the Javaworld podcast. As I pull into the driveway I see my wife waving frantically in the window. As geek brain struggles to process this, home brain kicks into gear. She needs me in the house now! I jump out of the car and slam the door shut, leaving all of the belongings I typically carry in the house.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;since I actively spent any time blogging. What you don&amp;rsquo;t know is that it has been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve done any writing whatsoever. The last two posts on this blog revolved around the birth of my first son, Grant Dawson, on May 16, 2009. This was one of several events that took place almost a year ago that sent me directly into a whirlwind of activity that found me barely keeping my head above water.</description>

      <description>So I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in quite awhile. I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather busy - here&amp;rsquo;s one VERY important reason why. Grant was born Friday, May 16, 2008, weighing in at 9 pounds 4 ounces and 22 inches long. Mom and baby are doing wonderfully, but as you can see, Dad is in a bit of shock!</description>

      <description>This is the view from my quaint little hotel room at the Hotel Nikko in downtown San Francisco, California. I arrived here after a long morning of travel. First ~4 hours of flight from Memphis, TN to San Francisco International, followed by traversing the airport maze to find the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train station. Once I found the right station, it was another 15 minutes of waiting on a train followed by a 40 minute train ride.</description>

      <description>Apparently Matt Raible thought my JSF modifications to the AppFuse-Compass tutorial were good enough to merit a mention on his blog: AppFuse Videos updated for 1.9.3. Check out the bottom of the entry.
Compass really is a nice tool - I was able to provide search capabilities for an app I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now with about 2 days worth of work (having never worked w/ Compass before), and man is it fast!</description>
