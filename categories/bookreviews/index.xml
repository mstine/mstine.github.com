      <description>I recently started reading the beta copy of Bruce Tate&amp;rsquo;s Seven Languages in Seven Weeks from the Pragmatic Bookshelf. While I&amp;rsquo;m certainly NOT on pace to actually complete the book in seven weeks, I have been steadily plodding along. Reading this book takes me back to my days as an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Mississippi. As with most CS programs, we were all required to take a &amp;ldquo;Survey of Programming Languages&amp;rdquo; course toward the end of the curriculum.</description>
