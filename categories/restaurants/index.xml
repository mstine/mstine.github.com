      <description>for me, not for JavaOne. Of course I was a good little programmer and used the schedule builder to sign up for all of my sessions. I edited them a bit after the first two keynotes. Even then, I had one lone session scheduled for Thursday morning (that wasn&amp;rsquo;t really directly applicable to my work, it just looked interesting), and then two sessions in the afternoon, the first starting at 4:10.</description>

      <description>I ended up at the restaurant across the street from the one pictured in my last entry. I found out from reading the reviews that it was the original, and then opened an additional location across the street. Strange, huh? At any rate, the Chicken Satay was definitely a 5-star dish for me. Even better than Bhan Thai back home in Memphis. I followed that up w/ the Thai Fried Rice w/ Beef.</description>
