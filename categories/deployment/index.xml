      <description>Interesting title, eh? Maybe this one will make it through Glen&amp;rsquo;s filter at GroovyBlogs.org.
On to the meat. I&amp;rsquo;ve been steadily working on a couple of Grails applications, one being the website for the Memphis JUG, and another being the e-commerce site for my wife&amp;rsquo;s soon to be launched designer stationery business. Just like your average Grails developer, I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily coding away at 127.0.0.1 using the good old development Jetty+MySQL stack.</description>
