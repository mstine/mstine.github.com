      <description>I spent about an hour last night reading through Francesco Cirillo&amp;rsquo;s e-book The Pomodoro Technique. Up until this point I knew the basics of the technique, but I really wanted to drill down and get the details. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain those here - visit http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/ to get the lowdown. What I want to talk about is my experience applying the technique this morning.
I managed to complete two Pomodoros. Each of the Pomodoros was filled with internal interruptions of various kinds.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;.because we&amp;rsquo;ve been packing to move on top of all of our regular projects. St. Jude has nicely renovated a new building for us, so we developers are moving. This is where I&amp;rsquo;m headed on Monday:
I&amp;rsquo;m both loving it and a little sad - I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting in my desk for nearly my entire career as a software developer. I just know I&amp;rsquo;m going to park in the garage and come downstairs one morning to find my office gone.</description>
