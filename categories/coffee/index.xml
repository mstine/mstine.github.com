      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday night, and what am I doing but coding. My wife&amp;rsquo;s night out is spent at the scrapbook store working on her latest layouts - mine is at my new favorite coffee shop, working on open source. I discovered this place on a date with Wendy a couple of months ago. The nice thing about it is the distinctly Christian atmosphere. A good friend of mine and I meet here on Friday mornings for accountability.</description>
